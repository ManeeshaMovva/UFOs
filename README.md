# UFOs

## Overview of the Project

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like us to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. We will be assisting her with this task using JavaScript. By creating filters to make this table full dynamic, the webpage will react to user input and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. I will be customizing the webpage using Bootstrap and equip my table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with the data. 

## Results

After building out the initial website, Dana wanted us to add filters to help users navigate specifically to the information they’re focused on, such as UFOs sightings in California or in another country altogether.

By adding the filters, you can now view results on a more granular level. The data can be filtered by using the date, city, state, country, or shape of UFO parameters. As people are searching for UFO sightings, adding the filters will make it easier for them to focus on any specific areas to help their research. Looking at the image, the subheaders for each parameter makes it easy to the user to know where to input each piece of information. You can choose to apply one filter or multiple filters. 

## Summary

### Drawback:

A drawback of this webpage is that the data is currently stored and linked to the webpage which means you won’t be able to display UFO data if it’s not in the table. We can assume that we have all of the UFO Sighting data for a given time period but if we missed any, it would not show up as it’s not in the table. Also, using the table means this data is point in time and does not update real time. 

### Recommendations:

•	One recommendation that I have is providing the link to where we got this information as proof to show that what is being displayed on the website is correct and we have sources. 
•	Another recommendation I have is allowing the user to filter using multiple countries, dates, cities, etc.
